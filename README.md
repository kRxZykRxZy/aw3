# aw3

## Setup

To setup aw3 you will need to install Bun: https://bun.com/docs/installation. aw3 uses Bun as the package
manager and as the server.

To setup the dev environment:

```
bun install
bun dev
```

## Licensing

aw3 is licenced under the AGPLv3 or at your option, any later version. See `COPYING` for more information.

Some files are taken from ampmod-web-front under the MIT licence, and the ampmod gui package under the GPLv3.

aw3 is also planned to be able to load the AmpMod editor from a bundle. aw3 does not come with the AmpMod
source code, which must be cloned and built separately. Even then, the GPLv3 and MPLv2 used by AmpMod explicitly
permits usage of the code inside an AGPL program. Talk to a lawyer for more information, as we aren't one.
