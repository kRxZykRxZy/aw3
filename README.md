making it easier to create larger and more complicated projects.

## Setup

In AmpMod, `pnpm` is used instead of `npm`.

Run `pnpm i` in the root directory to install all packages needed.

## Forking

Here are some important recommendations for forks. Since AmpMod is free and open-source, we don't strictly require
you to follow these. However, we recommend you do so.

- **Change the branding of your mod.** This is perhaps the most important change for a fork. Instead of modifying
  `packages/gui/src/lib/brand.js`, you should modify `packages/branding/src/index.js`. You will especially
  want to change `APP_NAME` and `APP_SOURCE`.
- **Create your own accent colour.** We recommend using a colour from the Scratch category palette, or at least a colour
  made to look like it. Some other accent colours like `rainbow` and `grey` already exist; you can use those.
- **Please release your source code.** Not doing so is illegal and violates the GPL/MPL. However, you _are_ allowed to
  use the files outside of `packages` and `.woodpecker` in closed-source projects, as those are under 0BSD.

## Licence

Licencing of each package varies; however, they are all open-source. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for more information.
