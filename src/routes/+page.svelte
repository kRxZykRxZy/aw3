    AmpMod is a block-based programming language built off <a
      class="link"
      href="https://turbowarp.org">TurboWarp</a
    > that adds many small but meaningful features to Scratch to make it even better, such as first-class
    lists, case sensitivity, custom extensions, and more! AmpMod is developed by a small but passionate
    community of Scratchers who want capabilities beyond the intended purpose of the language.

    ampmod.org will soon host all official AmpMod websites including the upcoming project sharing
    service, editor, wiki, forums, etc. However, it is not available to most users yet, but we want
    you to be one of the first to know when it does! We encourage you to check the existing
    community of AmpMod users: <span class="text-sm italic"
      >(Note: These links will change once the ampmod.org migration is complete.)</span

      You can use the AmpMod editor <a class="link" href="https://ampmod.codeberg.page/editor"
        >here</a
      >. We're working on a desktop app that will be available to download on ampmod.org soon.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <a class="link" href="https://ampmod.flarum.cloud">AmpMod Forums</a> are the main hub for community
      discussion, support, and feature suggestions. It is technically a primitive "project sharing service"
      as .apz files can be uploaded - however, the ampmod.org service will take this further and introduce
      the ability to remix, update projects easily, integrate with the editor, and more.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <a class="link" href="https://ampmod.miraheze.org">AmpMod Wiki</a> is the official encyclopedia
      for AmpMod, where you can find info about blocks, extensions, and community phenomena.

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">FAQ</h2>
  <h3 class="text-2xl">What is ampmod.org?</h3>
  <p>
    ampmod.org will be a website that hosts essentially every official part of the AmpMod community.
    You will be able to use the wiki, post on the forums, and even share projects on ampmod.org.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-2xl">Why does AmpMod exist?</h3>
  <p>
    Scratch is tightly controlled by its developers at the Scratch Foundation, who target it at
    beginners. Because of this, the Scratch Team has rejected several complex features, and people
    eventually stop using it and learn languages like Python instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, we do believe block-based programming allows people to quickly build projects. That's
    why we made AmpMod - an advanced modification of Scratch.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-2xl">What will happen to the forums and wiki?</h3>
  <p>
    The forums and wiki wil become subdomains hosted on the ampmod.org servers. Users on the AmpMod
    Wiki will be deleted during the migration, so you will have to create an account on ampmod.org
    to use the wiki.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-2xl">Will ampmod.org support mobile devices?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. However, the editor is not supported on phones. You will still be able to use the main
    ampmod.org service, the wiki, and the forums.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-2xl">Will AmpMod ever feature any full AI integration into the editor?</h3>
  <p>
    No. However, there are already extensions such as Face Sensing that use non-generative AI to
    sense your face.
